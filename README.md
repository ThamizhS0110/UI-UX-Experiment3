# UI-UX Experiment 3: Heuristic Evaluation & Redesign

## Aim
Perform a Heuristic Evaluation of competitor apps/websites, analyze user experience for key features, redesign with improved UX, and document findings.

---

## Algorithm

1. **Select & Compare:** Pick 2–3 competitor apps/websites (Swiggy, Zomato, Movie Ticket Booking App, Online Pharmacy App).
2. **Evaluate:** Check usability and visibility for main features via heuristic evaluation.
3. **Analyze:** Record navigation steps, taps, user effort, and satisfaction.
4. **Redesign:** Propose and create improved versions for higher visibility and easier access.

---

## Procedure

1. Open each app and locate the main user feature (e.g., Reorder, Quick Book).
2. Note the number of steps/taps and where the feature is placed.
3. Design new prototypes with the feature in a more prominent position (e.g., top bar/home screen).
4. Have users complete the main task in both original and redesigned apps.
5. Record usability metrics: time taken, taps, ease of access, and satisfaction.
6. Compare results for improved UX.
7. Collect feedback, analyze, and document findings.
8. Summarize improvements.

## Heuristic Evaluation Criteria

- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency
- Aesthetic and minimal design
- Help users recover from errors
- Help and documentation

## Comparative Example

| Feature            | Traditional App         | Redesigned Prototype         |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Quick Book/Reorder | Hidden in tabs/profile | Top bar, prominent button   |
| Taps Needed        | 3–4                    | 1–2                         |
| Visibility         | Low/Medium             | High                        |
| User Satisfaction  | Moderate               | High                        |
